# Dirbuster lab

A lab about dirbuster in the directory enumeration part of INE Penetration Tester Student path.

An instance of the Mutillidae web application can be accessed at http://demo.ine.local. The goal is to perform directory enumeration on the given target application.

## 1. Directory and file enumeration with Dirbuster GUI

* Set the target URL to http://demo.ine.local
* Select "List based brute force" as the scan type and a wordlist to use, in this case /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt was chosen. 
* Set file extensions to .php, .txt and .bak
* From advanced options, set limit for requests / second to 50
* Run the scan

Lots of directories and files found, including http://demo.ine.local/data/accounts.xml, which includes usernames and passwords.

The Dirbuster scan can be routed through a proxy, such as Burp Suite by specifying the proxy host from Options > Advanced Options > Http Options. The correct host address should be checked from Burp Suites Proxy > Options > Proxy Listeners. 

## 2. Directory and file enumeration using dirb

Run the dirb scanner with the following command:

    dirb http://demo.ine.local /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/small.txt

The following directories are found:

* http://demo.ine.local/classes/                                                                           
* http://demo.ine.local/config/                                                                            
* http://demo.ine.local/data/                                                                              
* http://demo.ine.local/images/                                                                            
* http://demo.ine.local/includes/                                                                          
* http://demo.ine.local/javascript/                                                                        
* http://demo.ine.local/passwords/                                                                         
* http://demo.ine.local/phpmyadmin/                                                                        
* http://demo.ine.local/test/  

A file called accounts.xml can be found in http://demo.ine.local/data/ and the same information in a text-file in http://demo.ine.local/passwords/accounts.txt. 

dirb scan can be routed through a proxy, such as Burp Suite by specifying the proxy address with -p flag:

    dirb http://demo.ine.local/ /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/small.txt -p 127.0.0.1:8080

The correct address should be checked from Burp Suites Proxy > Options > Proxy Listeners.
