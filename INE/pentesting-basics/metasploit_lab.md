# Metasploit

## Objective

A vulnerable application can be accessed using the tools installed on Kali on http://demo.ine.local. 

1. Identify available services on the target

    * 80 - HTTP - HttpFileServer 2.3
    * 135 - RPC
    * 139 - NetBIOS
    * 445 - SMB
    * 3389 - RDP

2. Find vulnerability of the target application

3. Exploit the target using Metasploit Framework

4. Obtain SYSTEM privileges on the machine

5. Install Persistence backdoor

6. Extract AutoLogin credentials

## Target info

* Host: demo.ine.local - 10.2.17.143 (10.2.25.141 after lab crash and restart)


## 1. Identify available services on the target

Check that the host is live and get the IP:

Run a port scan with nmap:

Find more information about the HTTP service with:

    nmap -A -O -p 80 10.2.17.143

We find out the HttpFileServer is run with HFS 2.3. 

## 2. Find vulnerability of the target application

The exploit exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec can be found for HFS:

## 3. Exploit the target using Metasploit Framework

Use the exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec using the default payload, set the RHOSTS option to the target and check the LHOST ip-address. The exploit can then be run, giving us a meterpreter shell:

(At this point the lab crashed and needed to be restarted, IP address of target changed to 10.2.25.141)

## 4. Obtain SYSTEM privileges on the machine

Once we have a meterpreter shell, check the system info and the user priviledges we obtain:

    sysinfo

    getuid

We can see, that the server is running on Windows Server 2016 and we have Administrator priviledges. 

We can use the meterpreter script getsystem to escalate our priviledges to local system:
